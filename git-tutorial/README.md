We're going to try playing around with Git by having everyone mess around with this repository ("repo"). First everyone will clone the repo, and then submit a change.

# Fork & Clone the Repo
"Forking" a repo means making a copy of it. Conventionally, the original repo is referred to as `upstream`, while the fork is known as `origin`.

"Cloning" a repo means taking a snapshot of the code stored remotely (in this case on GitHub) and downloading it to your computer. The code stored on GitHub is `remote`, and the code on your computer is `local`.

## Create a directory to put the code into
Open up your terminal (âŒ˜+Space and search for "Terminal").
Navigate to your root directory (`~/`), and create a folder named `code`.
>! `cd ~/; mkdir code`

Navigate into the `code` directory.
>! `cd code`

## Fork the Repo
Follow the directions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) to fork and clone this repo. Instead of `Spoon-Knife`, you will be forking: https://github.com/rupalivohra/teched-cmd-git.

Complete the steps in "Fork an Example Repository" and "Keep Your Fork Synced."

### Tips
* When cloning, use the `HTTPS` link. You'll probably be prompted for your GitHub credentials, so make sure you have those handy!
